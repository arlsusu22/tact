**Last Updated:** February 18, 2026

## Overview

tact ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our iOS application.

## Information We Collect

### Screen Time Data
- tact uses Apple's Screen Time API to access your device usage data
- This data includes app usage duration, category information, and usage patterns
- **All Screen Time data remains on your device** — we do not transmit, store, or process this data on external servers

### Local Data Storage
tact stores the following data locally on your device:
- Daily usage statistics and history
- Notification preferences and settings
- Daily goal configuration
- Streak tracking information
- Notification delivery logs

This data is stored using:
- iOS UserDefaults within an App Group container
- Local device storage only
- No cloud sync or external transmission

### Data We Do NOT Collect
- We do not collect personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- We do not use analytics services
- We do not use advertising networks
- We do not transmit your Screen Time data to our servers or any third party
- We do not track your location
- We do not access your contacts, photos, or other personal data

## How We Use Your Information

Screen Time data accessed through Apple's API is used solely to:
- Display your usage statistics in the app
- Calculate daily goals and streaks
- Deliver awareness notifications based on your usage patterns
- Generate usage insights and comparisons

All processing happens locally on your device.

## Data Sharing

**We do not share your data with any third parties.** Your Screen Time data never leaves your device.

## Subscription and Payment Information

If you purchase a subscription through the app:
- Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple through the App Store
- We use StoreKit to verify your subscription status
- We do not collect or store your payment information
- Apple's privacy policy governs how your payment data is handled

## Data Security

- All data is stored locally on your device using iOS's secure storage mechanisms
- Data is protected by your device's passcode and biometric authentication
- App Group containers restrict data access to authorized app extensions only

## Your Rights

You have full control over your data:
- **Delete Data:** Use the "Clear All Data" function in Settings to delete all locally stored information
- **Uninstall:** Deleting the app removes all associated data from your device
- **Screen Time Authorization:** You can revoke Screen Time access at any time through iOS Settings > Screen Time > Family Controls

## Children's Privacy

tact does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The app requires Screen Time authorization, which is restricted on devices managed with parental controls.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be reflected by the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Third-Party Services

tact does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app uses only Apple's native frameworks:
- StoreKit (subscription management)
- FamilyControls and DeviceActivity (Screen Time API)
- UserNotifications (local notifications)

## Data Retention

- Data is retained locally on your device until you manually delete it or uninstall the app
- No data is retained on external servers
- Uninstalling the app permanently removes all associated data
